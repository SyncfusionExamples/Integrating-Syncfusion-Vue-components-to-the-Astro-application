# Integrating Syncfusion Vue components to the Astro project

This article provides a step-by-step guide for setting up an Astro JS project and integrating the Syncfusion Vue Rich Text Editor components.

An `Astro JS` application, which is a modern web framework, is designed for creating high-performing websites and web applications with ease. By seamlessly combining Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Client-side Hydration, Astro empowers developers to build robust, interactive digital experiences.

## Benefits for Astro project

**Efficient Rendering**: Astro combines Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Client-side Hydration to efficiently render web pages. This hybrid approach ensures fast initial loading times and seamless transitions between server-rendered and client-rendered content.

**Improved Performance**: By optimizing the loading process, Astro helps improve website performance. It prioritizes critical content for faster delivery, resulting in better user experiences and reduced bounce rates.

**Flexible Architecture**: Astro supports various front-end frameworks and libraries, including React, Vue.js, Svelte, and more. This flexibility allows developers to choose the tools that best suit their project requirements and preferences.

## Steps to run the Astro project

1\. Begin by using Node.js version - `v18.14.1` or higher.

2\. Install dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

3\. To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4321/` in your preferred browser to see the rendered Syncfusion Vue components within the Astro project.
