# Integrating Syncfusion Vue components to the Astro project

An `Astro JS` project, which is a modern web framework, is designed for creating high-performing websites and web applications with ease. By seamlessly combining Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Client-side Hydration, Astro empowers developers to build robust, interactive digital experiences.

This repository contains a demo sample showcasing the integration of Syncfusion Vue components with the Astro project.

## Steps to run the Astro project

1\. Begin by ensuring the Node.js version - `v18.14.1` or higher is installed.

2\. Install dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

3\. To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
